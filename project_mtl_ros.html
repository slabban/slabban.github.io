        <section>
            <p>
                Deep Learning was a fascinating but elusive field to me during my time as a masters student.
                By the time I graduated in 2020, I was too busy breaking into the software development scene and landing
                my first job to explore its depths. Back then, landing a machine engineering role was rare, with an
                intimidatingly high bar for entry. It seemed like a moonshot for someone with my
                experience, so I put it on hold.

                <br><br>

                Fast forward to today, I get to work on cutting-edge perception-centered features in production
                autonomous driving applications, and my software engineering skills have been accelerating. With a
                clearer vision of the engineering and cross-team workflows, I figured it was time to dive in.

                The video above illustrates depth and semantic segmentation inferences from a Hydranet model deployed in
                ROS2 middleware. The image stream is vehicle sensor data that my friends and I collected while driving
                around my university campus.

                <br><br>

                Coined by <strong>Tesla</strong>, the term <i>Hydranet</i> is single deep learning model that is capable
                of
                inferencing multiple tasks, as opposed to the convention of deploying models that perform a single task,
                which would place needless memory constraints on the hardware. Hydranets have been an interal concept
                in autonomous driving applications due to this efficiency.

            <h2>Setting Learning Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Deep learning is an ever-evolving field, making it challenging to know where to begin and how to
                effectively advance towards cutting-edge techniques.
                In addition, deploying and integrating these models can be particularly complex in robotics, where high
                throughput
                and real-time performance are essential.

                <br><br>

                Aiming for a balance between research and deployment, I set the following objectives:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop the ability to understand and critically assess state-of-the-art deep learning papers.</li>
                <li>Gain hands-on experience in building and training deep learning models.</li>
                <li>Learn to deploy machine learning models within robotic systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Deep Learning Path</h2>

            <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>
                Having just graduated with my second engineering degree, I wasn't too keen on shelling out more cash for
                education. I chose the
                cost-effective, scenic route picking up the basics.

                <br><br>

                I started with a miniseries on <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU">Deep Learning
                    Fundamentals</a>, which taught me the basics of deep learning. I then graduated to fastai's <a
                    href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep
                    Learning
                    for Coders</a>. This course did <i>wonders</i> for me as it gave me hands-on experience on a breadth
                of machine learning avenues,
                from classical concepts such <strong>Random Forests</strong>, to <strong>Convolutional Neural
                    Networks</strong> and <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> using Transformers.

                My last venture on fundamentals was Deep Lizard's <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG">PyTorch-Python Deep
                    Learning API</a>, which further drove down on my practical experience, but with a tailored focus to
                the popular Pytorch framework.
            </p>

            <h3>Automated Driving</h3>
            <p>
                My next move was to specialize in deep learning for autonomous driving, I enrolled in Jeremy Cohen's <a
                    href="https://courses.thinkautonomous.ai/">Think
                    Autonomous</a> courses for Hydranets and Neural Net Optimization. These courses were very helpful in
                getting a intuitive understanding more advanced concepts and techniques, some of which we will discuss
                in the next sections.

            <h2>Hydranet Architecture</h2>
            <p> Simply put, a Hydranet, officially termed as <i>Multi-Task Learning</i>, is a deep learning model
                that is designed and trained to inference multiple outputs. They're popular due to their efficiency and
                low latency,
                as they allow multiple tasks to share a common feature extraction backbone, reducing the overall
                computational load. This shared representation not only conserves resources but often improves the
                performance of each task by leveraging the complementary nature of shared features.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/hydranet.png"
                    alt="Diagram of the Hydranet architecture, including encoder and decoder structure"
                    class="project-image">
            </figure>

            <p>

                The Hydranet architecture we studied was from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04766">this paper</a>.
                Much like the well-known <strong>U-Net</strong>, this model follows an encoder-decoder architecture. The
                encoder takes in a single image and reduces the spatial dimensions while increasing feature channels,
                and the decoder restores
                spatial dimensions with skip connections from the encoder. This enables the model to retain spatial
                features while leveraging the encoderâ€™s feature extraction power.
            </p>
            <p>
                For real-time applications, the authors of the paper focused on efficiency, using <strong>Mobilenet
                    V2</strong> as the encoder and a lightweight <strong>RefineNet</strong> as the decoder. They authors
                also
                incorporated techniques like depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and
                floating-point
                operations of the model during inference
            </p>

            <h2>Considerations for Multi-Task Learning</h2>

            <p>We looked at a thin slice of Multi-Task Learning, but I think it's worth sharing these
                considerations.</p>

            <h3>Loss Weighting</h3>
            <p>A loss function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the model's predictions
                and the ground truth labels, which are applied to the model during the training phase. So how do we
                handle
                multiple loss functions from different tasks? </p>
            <p> <strong>Uncertainty weighting</strong> is a early approach that allows the model to capture the complex
                interplay between tasks and balance performance across them by weighting each loss function by the
                uncertainty of each task. These uncertainties are parameters that are aim to balance the learning of the
                model.
            </p>
            <p>Another approach is <strong>GradNorm</strong>, which is a gradient-based method that dynamically
                adjusts the learning rate of each task based on its relative importance. By normalizing the gradients
                of each task, GradNorm ensures that the model is updated in a way that is proportional to the
                importance of each task. This helps to balance performance across tasks and improve overall
                performance.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Meta-Learning Task Weighting</strong> is a method that uses meta-learning to
                automatically adjust the weights of each task based on the performance of the model. This approach
                involves training a meta-model to predict the optimal weights for each task, given the current
                performance of the model. By using the meta-model to adjust the weights of each task, this approach
                can improve overall performance and balance performance across tasks.</p>

            <h3>Task Dependence</h3>
            <p>Deciding which tasks to learn is a crucial consideration.
                Some tasks may be inherently related, where learning one task can benefit the learning of another, and
                improve the model's accuracy,
                while certain pairings of tasks may negatively impact model learning and convergence.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="./images/task_dependency.png"
                    alt="Diagram of the Hydranet architecture, including encoder and decoder structure"
                    class="project-image">
            </figure>

            <p> The snippet above comes from this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07553" Paper>paper</a>. Here the
                authors highlight results from pairing tasks. We see that including the normals task gave a generous
                boost in peformance, whereas
                synergies between semantic and depth did not provide much benefit. You can actually improve the
                performance of
                the model by including extra tasks such as normals, even if they are not relevant to the task at hand.

            <h2>Model Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>ROS2</strong> (Robot Operating System 2) is an open-source middleware that
                acts
                as a communication layer between different processes and hardware devices, enabling efficient data
                exchange while providing a modular design.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to deploying deep learning models, the process typically involves
                converting
                the model from a development environment to a production-ready format that can run efficiently in
                real-time applications.
                In my case, I wanted to integrate the Hydranet model into ROS2, aiming to learn both ROS2 and deep
                learning together. Initially, I used <strong>JIT</strong> to trace the model and
                the <strong>Libtorch</strong> C++ API,
                to handle, import and inferecing in ROS2. This allowed me to take a model from eager mode and deploy it
                into production mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there are more official ways to deploy machine learning models in ROS2 or similar systems. For
                instance, <strong>ONNX</strong> (Open Neural Network Exchange) allows for easy model export and
                cross-platform
                deployment. ONNX models can be used across frameworks and hardware, ensuring compatibility with
                performance-optimized libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                For even more performance gains, specialized tools like <strong>Intel's OpenVINO</strong> or NVIDIAâ€™s
                suite of optimization
                technologies can be employed. OpenVINO is designed to speed up inferencing on Intel hardware, allowing
                you to optimize your
                ONNX models and deploy them across CPU, GPU, and even FPGAs. NVIDIA's <strong>TensorRT</strong> is
                another powerful tool
                that provides optimizations for NVIDIA GPUs, turning ONNX models into highly optimized runtime engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the ROS2 ecosystem, NVIDIA offers <strong>Isaac ROS</strong> for seamless integration of TensorRT
                models into ROS nodes.
                This allows for faster inference and better performance in tasks such as object detection, segmentation,
                and other
                perception tasks within the robotics system. Using these tools, you can not only deploy your models but
                also
                benefit from hardware-accelerated inferencing, making the integration process much more efficient and
                suitable for
                real-time applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my case, after training the Hydranet model, I converted it to ONNX and used TensorRT for
                optimization. This
                allowed me to deploy it in a ROS2 node, where it processes camera images, runs inferences, and outputs
                depth
                and segmentation data efficiently in real-time.
