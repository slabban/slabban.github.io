        <h1 class="title">A Perspective on Birds Eye View (BEV) Networks</h1>


        <section>
            <h2>Why BEV Networks?</h2>
            <p>If you’ve been following advancements in 3D perception for autonomous driving, you’ve likely come across
                Bird’s Eye View (BEV) networks. But what are they? There are many different approaches these days, but
                to put it simply, a BEV network is a type of deep
                learning model that takes in sensor input such as images form a camera and outputs a representation of
                the
                scene from a top-down perspective. They’re becoming a go-to method for enhancing how self-driving cars
                “see” the world. </p>

            <img src="./images/bev_lps.gif" alt="Lift-Splat-Shoot Process" class="project-image" />

            <p>Shown above is one of the pioneering papers in this space, <a
                    href="https://github.com/nv-tlabs/lift-splat-shoot">Lift-Splat-Shoot</a>. Using inputs from six
                cameras of around the driving vehicle, this BEV network
                is able to generate a single unified representation of the surrounding vehicles.</p>

            <p>What makes BEV so attractive? It handles three crucial symmetries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Translation Equivariance</strong>: Shift an image, and the output shifts along with it.
                    Fully convolutional single-
                    image object detectors roughly have this property and the BEV Nets inherits this from them.</li>
                <li><strong>Permutation Invariance</strong>: The camera order doesn’t matter; the results are the same.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ego-Frame Isometry Equivariance</strong>: No matter where the camera is placed, it’ll detect
                    the same objects in the ego frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By preserving these properties and being fully end-to-end differentiable, BEV networks streamline the
                perception process.</p>

            <h2>Understanding The BEV Landscape</h2>

            <p>Here’s the thing—I don’t have a PhD from Carnegie Mellon or MIT. For a long time, I thought breaking into
                such a complex field without one was intimidating. But as I progressed in my career and became more
                established in the automated driving industry, I realized something: being passionate about learning and
                sharing that journey has been my greatest asset. With this project, my goal is to show everyone,
                regardless of skill level, my unique perspective on BEV with the hope to inspire others to do the same.
            </p>

            <p>Above is a snapshot into my BEV mind map, created with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Using
                this app, I was able to gradually expand my knowledge in
                BEV networks, starting with the <i>depth-based</i> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10490">Fiery</a>
                and eventually going across the main approaches discussed in this project.

            <h2>Datasets That Power BEV</h2>
            <img src="./images/BEV_Datasets.png" alt="bev lift strategies" class="project-image" />

            <p>To get BEV networks to work, we rely on some heavyweight datasets offering diverse scenes for training
                and testing. Three of the big names are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>KITTI</strong>: A well-known benchmark with over 7,500 samples for testing with both 2D and
                    3D annotations.</li>
                <li><strong>nuScenes</strong>: A massive dataset with 1,000 scenes, each lasting 20 seconds, offering a
                    360-degree field of view.</li>
                <li><strong>Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)</strong>: One of the largest autonomous driving datasets with
                    nearly 800 sequences for training.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other datasets worth mentioning include <strong>Argoverse</strong>, <strong>H3D</strong>, and
                <strong>Lyft L5</strong>, which are also popular for testing BEV models.

            <h2>Different BEV Approaches</h2>

            <img src="./images/lift_strategies.png" alt="bev lift strategies" class="project-image" />
            <figcaption>
                <p>Shown above is an illustration of four different approaches to transforming perspective view (PV)
                    images into bird's eye view (BEV) representations. The four quadrants demonstrate (clockwise from
                    top-left): <i>MLP-Based, Depth-based, Learning-based</i></p>

            </figcaption>

            <p>There’s no single “right” way to transform images from regular perspective view (PV) into BEV.
                Researchers have explored several approaches, but they generally fall into two main categories:</p>

            <h3>Geometric-Based PV2BEV</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Homography-Based</strong>: Also known as <strong>Invese Perspective Mapping</strong>. Most
                    applications of this actually don't use neural networks, but instead applies simple
                    geometric transformations on the sensor intrinsics and extrinsics to get a BEV-like view. This falls
                    in the traditional realm of Robotics algorithms and has been used extensively in perception
                    pipelines. However, this technique falls short due to the assumption that the ground is flat. While
                    that may align to certain individuals beliefs, it can lead to inaccurate results for more advanced
                    driving functionalities.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Depth-Based</strong>: As the name eludes, depth based networks rely on extracting depth from
                    image features to project 2D images into 3D space. Starting in 2019 with single image detection from
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08188">OFT</a>, depth networks had seen major developments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notable works include <strong>Lift-Splat-Shoot</strong>, <strong>Fiery</strong>, and
                <strong>BEVDepth</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Network-Based PV2BEV</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MLP-Based</strong>: These models use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to map PV images into BEV
                    space, learning the transformation through data.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformer-Based</strong>: Transformers are becoming more popular due to their ability to
                    handle relationships between features in a data-driven way.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notable works include <strong>BEVFormer</strong> and <strong>PanopticBEV</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Do We Compare These Methods?</h2>
            <p>Comparing BEV methods isn’t easy. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. That’s where
                <strong>Simple-BEV</strong> comes in—a benchmark designed to level the playing field for various BEV
                methodologies. By simplifying the comparison, it helps researchers evaluate models more fairly.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Multi-Task Learning with BEV Networks</h2>
            <p>BEV networks often deal with multiple tasks like object detection and segmentation. Multi-task learning
                is a popular way to handle this, and one method that stands out is <strong>Uncertainty
                    Weighting</strong>, where tasks are prioritized dynamically based on their difficulty or importance.
            </p>
            <p>Other methods include <strong>GradNorm</strong> and <strong>Meta-Learning Task Weighting</strong>, which
                adjust task weights to balance performance across different objectives.</p>
