            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a deep dive into the world of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) where I employed the powerful <strong>Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)</strong> and an <strong>Intersection Over Union (IoU)</strong> association approach to track objects in a video stream. I deployed the algorithm in the <strong>Robot Operating System (ROS)</strong> middleware, which allowed me to tap into the vast ecosystem of ROS packages and tools.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                My inspiration for this project came from this <a href="https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/computer-vision-for-tracking/">article</a> by Jeremy Cohen. I had come across it over a year ago and thought: "I know how to design a Kalman Filter and have worked on Multiple Object Tracking, I should give this a shot." So, I did!

            <h2>Results and Comparisons</h2>

            <p>
                I experimented with both <strong>YOLOv3</strong> and <strong>YOLOv4</strong>, comparing results as seen in the video above. While <strong>YOLOv4</strong> was better at association, <strong>YOLOv3</strong> performed detections faster, which allowed the Kalman Filter to produce smoother estimates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <strong>YOLOv3</strong>, I achieved a detection output rate of 17 HZ and an estimate rate of 50 HZ on my trusty 2017 laptop with a 1060 GPU. Meanwhile, <strong>YOLOv4</strong> reduced the rate to 7.5 HZ but produced more accurate results. Iâ€™m curious how better-calibrated input images could improve performance further.

            <h2>Multi-Object Tracking Algorithm Breakdown</h2>
            <p>
                My algorithm, like most MOTs, follows these five key steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detection</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Association</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Track Identity Creation & Destruction</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Estimation</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Challenges and Alternatives</h2>
            <p>
                There are some drawbacks to classical approaches like the Extended Kalman Filter, such as tracking loss through ID swaps during occlusion. Approaches like <strong>SORT</strong>, which use the Hungarian Algorithm for association, can mitigate these issues. For even more robust solutions, <i>DeepSort</i> leverages feature maps from a <strong>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</strong> for association. You can learn more about DeepSort <a href="https://medium.com/augmented-startups/deepsort-deep-learning-applied-to-object-tracking-924f59f99104">here</a>.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a fantastic learning experience. The open-source community has taught me a lot, and I hope this project can contribute in return and inspire others to take on similar challenges!
