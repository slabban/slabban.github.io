    <!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
    <p class="intro">
        This project was a classical approach to Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) using the popular Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Intersection Over Union (IoU) association approach within the Robot Operating System (ROS) Middleware.
    </p>

    <!-- Inspiration Story -->
    <p class="inspiration">
        My inspiration for this project came from this <a href="https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/computer-vision-for-tracking/">article</a> by Jeremy Cohen. I came across it over a year ago and thought: "I know how to design a Kalman Filter and have worked on Multiple Object Tracking, I should give this a shot." So, I did!
    </p>

    <!-- YOLO Model Comparison -->
    <p class="model-comparison">
        I experimented with both YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, comparing results as seen in the video above. YOLOv4 was better at association, but YOLOv3 performed detections faster, producing smoother estimates. Using YOLOv3, I achieved a detection output rate of 17 HZ and estimate rate of 50 HZ, while YOLOv4 brought the rate down to 7.5 HZ but produced more accurate results. I am curious about how better-calibrated input images could further improve performance.
    </p>

    <!-- MOT Breakdown -->
    <p class="method-breakdown">My algorithm, like most MOTs, follows these 5 steps:</p>
    <ul class="algorithm-steps">
        <li>Detection</li>
        <li>Association</li>
        <li>Track Identity Creation</li>
        <li>Estimation</li>
        <li>Track Identity Destruction</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Methodology Drawbacks -->
    <p class="drawbacks">
        There are some drawbacks to classical approaches like mine, including tracking loss through ID swaps and occlusion. While <strong>SORT</strong>, using the Hungarian Algorithm for association, can reduce these issues, <strong>DeepSort</strong> offers a more robust solution by leveraging feature maps from RCNN for association.

    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <p class="conclusion">
        Though my algorithm isn't state of the art, I am extremely proud of the results. I've learned so much from the open-source community, and I hope this project can contribute in return.
