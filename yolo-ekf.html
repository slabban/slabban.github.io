        <!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
        <p class="intro">
            This project was an deep dive into the world of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) where I employed the powerful <i>Extended Kalman Filter</i>
             (EKF) and an <i>Intersection Over Union</i> (IoU) association approach to track objects in a video stream. I was able to deploy the algorithm
            in the Robot Operating System (ROS) Middleware, which allowed me to tap into the vast ecosystem of ROS packages and tools.

        <!-- Inspiration Story -->
        <p class="inspiration">
            My inspiration for this project came from this <a
                href="https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/computer-vision-for-tracking/">article</a> by Jeremy Cohen. I
            came across it over a year ago and thought: "I know how to design a Kalman Filter and have worked on
            Multiple Object Tracking, I should give this a shot." So, I did!

        </a>

        <!-- YOLO Model Comparison -->
        <p class="model-comparison">
            I experimented with both <strong>YOLOv3</strong> and <strong>YOLOv4</strong>, comparing results as seen in the video above. <strong>YOLOv4</strong> was better
            at association, but <strong>YOLOv3</strong> performed detections faster, which allowed the Kalman Filter to produce smoother estimates. Using <strong>YOLOv3</strong>, I
            achieved a detection output rate of 17 HZ and estimate rate of 50 HZ on my dingy but reliable 2017 Laptop with a 1060 GPU, while <strong>YOLOv4</strong> brought the rate down to
            7.5 HZ but produced more accurate results. I am curious about how better-calibrated input images could
            further improve performance.

        <!-- MOT Breakdown -->
        <p class="method-breakdown">My algorithm, like most MOTs, follows these 5 steps:</p>
        <ul class="algorithm-steps">
            <li><strong>Detection</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Association</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Track Identity Creation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Estimation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Track Identity Destruction</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Methodology Drawbacks -->
        <p class="drawbacks">
            There are some drawbacks to classical approaches like the Extended Kalman Filter sucha as tracking loss through ID swaps via
            occlusion. <strong>SORT</strong>, uses the Hungarian Algorithm for association, and can reduce these
            issues, <i>DeepSort</i> offers a more robust solution to the occlusion issue by leveraging feature maps from a Recurent Neural Network (RNN) for
            association. Learn more about DeepSort <a

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p class="conclusion">
            I had a great time with this project and learned so much from the open-source community. I hope this
            project can contribute in return and inspire others to take on similar projects!
